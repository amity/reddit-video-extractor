## Reddit Video Linker</h2>
Adds a button to the context menu (right-click) on reddit to directly link to a video hosted by reddit at v.redd.it. To use it, right click on the full link to a post (from the main page, this is the link saying "54 comments", or whatever number), and click "Get direct video link." A dialog will pop up allowing you to copy it directly.

#### Why does this exist?
I like linking stuff to my friends and got tired of having to link them the whole page. This will also allow GIFs to be properly expanded in Discord, Slack, etc.
Currently not released in any real capacity, but maybe I will at some point. Feel free to clone and [use it in Chrome on your own](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/).

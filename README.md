## Reddit Video Linker</h2>
Chrome extension that adds a button to the context menu (right-click) on reddit to directly link to a video hosted by reddit at v.redd.it. To use it, right click on the full link to a post (from the main page, this is the link saying "54 comments", or whatever number), and click "Get direct video link." A dialog will pop up allowing you to copy it directly.

#### FAQ
- Can't I just right-click and do "Copy video address?"
For many GIFs, yes. If they're hosted by imgur or giphy, you can do so. However, Reddit specifically blocks people from copying links to reddit-hosted files in that way.

- Does this work with videos with sound?
Unfortunately not. Only the visuals are accessible in this way; it is possible to also fetch the audio files, but as I'm not hosting these files externally, it is not possible to merge them via the Chrome extension at this time. 

#### What were those steps again?
1. Right-click on the link to the *post* (not the video).

#### Why does this exist?
I like linking stuff to my friends and got tired of having to link them the whole page.
Feel free to clone and [use it in Chrome on your own](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/), but it will also be released on the Chrome Web Store shortly

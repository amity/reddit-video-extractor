## Reddit Video Linker</h2>
Chrome extension that adds a button to the context menu (right-click) on reddit to directly link to a video hosted by reddit at v.redd.it. To use it, right click on the full link to a post (from the main page, this is the link saying "54 comments", or whatever number), and click "Get direct video link." A dialog will pop up allowing you to copy it directly.

#### What were those steps again?
1. Right-click on the link to the *post* (not the video).

3. Copy the link!

#### Why does this exist?
I like linking stuff to my friends and got tired of having to link them the whole page.
Feel free to clone and [use it in Chrome on your own](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/), but it will also be released on the Chrome Web Store shortly
